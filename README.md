# Machine-Learning-fundamentals

Machine learning projects in python with source code

## Linear Regression

1. Load a dataset and perform basic data exploration using a powerful data science library called [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).
2. Preprocess the data for linear regression.
3. Compute the cost and perform gradient descent in pure numpy in vectorized form.
4. Fit a linear regression model using a single feature.
5. Visualize my results using matplotlib.
6. Perform multivariate linear regression.
7. Pick the best features in the dataset.
8. Experiment with adaptive learning rates.

## Decision Trees

1. Practice OOP in python.
2. Implement two impurity measures: Gini and Entropy.
3. Construct a decision tree algorithm.
4. Prune the tree to achieve better results.
5. Visualize ny results.

# MAP Classifier

1. Implement a Naive Bayes Classifier based on Multi-Normal distribution
2. Implement a Full Bayes Classifier based on Multi-Normal distribution
3. Implement a Discrete Naive Bayes Classifier

# Logistic Regression, Bayes and EM

1. Implement Logistic Regression algorithm.
2. Implement EM algorithm.
3. Implement Navie Bayes algorithm that uses EM for calculating the likelihood.
4. Visualize my results.

# Clustering

k-means as an image compression algorithm.
