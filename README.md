2. Compute the cost and perform gradient descent in pure numpy in vectorized form.
3. Fit a linear regression model using a single feature.
4. Visualize my results using matplotlib.
5. Perform multivariate linear regression.
6. Pick the best features in the dataset.
7. Experiment with adaptive learning rates.

## Decision Trees

1. Implement two impurity measures: Gini and Entropy.
2. Construct a decision tree algorithm.
3. Prune the tree to achieve better results.
4. Visualize ny results.

# MAP Classifier

1. Implement a Naive Bayes Classifier based on Multi-Normal distribution
